US is leading by a considerable amount in terms of producing content on the Netflix, which is followed by India and UK. It matches the fact that Netflix is an US based
company and it first started in the United States.

US has good balance between number of movies and TV show they are producing on Netflix with movie to tv show ratio of 5:3. On the hand, India is majorly producing Movies on the Netflix, 93.2% of Indian contents are movies and only 6.81% of their content is TV shows. Similar trend is followed by Spain and Turkey.
However, opposite trend is found in South Korea and Japan. They are producing 75% of their content in form of TV shows.

Most of the content available on Netflix are not suitable for children below 14. They are only suitable for mature audiences (TVMA) and explicitly not suitable for children below 14 (TV-14).

Above stacked area chart serves both the purpose of line chart and compositional chart. It shows that Netflix had a slow start in the beginning years and then things began to pick up in 2015 with a rapid increase in 2016. However, it got drastically slowed down in 2020 during the pandemic considering the fact content creation was on hold. Movie had the major portion of composition all over these years.

There is also an interesting trend in number of content release over each month in a year. December and January have the highest number of releases, which is backed by an analysis that these are the months when people have a lot of time off from work.

## Distribution of Target Audience

One thing is common across countries, contents catered to the Kids are the minimum in numbers, followed by contents for older kids. Teens and Adults have fights in terms of proportion of targeted content in all the countries. In India, maximum of 54% is targeted for teens, however, in US maximum of 44% is targeted to adults. It is also interesting to note similarities between culturally similar countries - the US & UK are closely aligned with their Netflix target ages, yet vastly different to say, India or Japan!

In all the countries, there is significant gap between release data and upload date of content into the Netflix, which can be understood from the fact that first entertainment industry wants to earn money directly from theatres and cinemas before uploading it on the Netflix platform. However, this gap varies with countries as well as content type. This gap for TV shows is less and more regular in comparison with the movies. Spain has the lowest gap/age for both the movies and TV shows, whereas Japan and India higher gap for both the movies and TV shows.
